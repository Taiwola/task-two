# Person Module Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `Person` module in our Nest application. This document provides an overview of the module's structure and functionality.

## Application Overview

- **Application Type**: Nest Application
- **Source Code Location**: `src/modules/person`

## Folder Structure

Inside the `src/modules/person` directory, you will find the following folders and files:

- **`dto`**: This folder contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for defining the shape of data exchanged between the client and server. These DTOs help maintain data consistency and validation.

- **`entities`**: The `entities` folder holds the database models or entities that represent the `Person` data in our application. These entities define the structure of our data.

- **`test`**: The `test` folder includes unit and integration tests for the `Person` module. These tests ensure the correctness and reliability of our code.

- **`validator`**: The `validator` folder may contain custom validation classes or functions used for validating data related to the `Person` module.

- **`__mock__` (Optional): If present, this folder might contain mock data or utilities used in testing. It's a good practice to isolate mocks in this folder for testability.

- **`person.service.ts`**: The `person.service.ts` file is the service responsible for handling business logic related to `Person` entities. It interacts with the database, performs data operations, and contains the core functionality.

- **`person.controller.ts`**: The `person.controller.ts` file defines the HTTP endpoints for interacting with the `Person` module. It receives requests, delegates them to the service, and sends back responses.

- **`person.module.ts`**: The `person.module.ts` file is the module configuration file. It specifies the dependencies, controllers, services, and providers for the `Person` module.

## README.md

The `README.md` file in the root directory of our project briefly describes the API and provides information about its endpoints and usage. Additionally, it contains a link to a Postman documentation for a more comprehensive API reference.

We've also included a UML diagram outlining the structure of our API, illustrating the relationships between modules, controllers, services, and entities. This diagram can serve as a visual guide to understanding the application's architecture.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e
```

## Summary

The `Person` module is an integral part of our Nest application, responsible for managing and exposing endpoints related to person data. The folder structure and organization help maintain a clean and structured codebase, while the `README.md` provides essential information for developers and users alike.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the Postman documentation linked in the `README.md` file. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our development team.
